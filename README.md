### Hi there 🚀

I’m a senior full stack software developer from the U.S. with a passion for building end-to-end solutions in Angular, React, C#, and Python. Over the years, I’ve worked on everything from enterprise manufacturing systems to cross-platform apps with modern stacks like Supabase, Stripe, and cloud integrations (Azure & AWS).

I love solving hard problems, mentoring junior devs, and fine-tuning CI/CD pipelines to keep projects flowing smoothly 🚀.

When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me tinkering with my dev setup, testing out new frameworks “just because,” or rearranging my office space (again) in pursuit of the perfect workflow ⚡.
