### Hi there 🚀

I'm a senior software developer from the United States, currently working full-time on a full-stack knowledge management platform written in **Angular** and **C#**. Outside of work, I am an active facilitator of a local [Girls Who Code(https://girlswhocode.com/) chapter, hoping to empower the next generation of tech leaders and encourage diversity and inclusivity in the field.

When I'm not behind the keyboard, I spend entirely too much time tinkering with my development environment and rearranging my office space in pursuit of a perfectly optimized workflow! 🛠️🌟
