### Hi there 🚀

I'm Cody- a Senior Full Stack Developer and Technical Lead from the U.S. with over 5 years experience building scalable cloud applications on Azure and more than 8 years delivering software in manufacturing environments.

I work across **C#, Java, Python, TypeScript (React & Angular), SQL**, and **Azure**, leading teams through the full software lifecycle—architecture, implementation, CI/CD automation, and production releases. My background includes enterprise MES platforms, real-time ETL data pipelines, and cross-platform apps with modern stacks like Supabase, Stripe, and GitHub Actions.

I'm passionate about mentoring engineers, bridging business and technical teams, and improving delivery through strong Agile practices and engineering standards

When I'm not coding, you'll find me tinkering with my dev setup, testing out new frameworks "just because," or rearranging my office space (again) in pursuit of the perfect workflow ⚡.
